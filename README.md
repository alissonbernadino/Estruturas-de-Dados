### Estruturas-de-Dados
## Data struct and algoritms in C++
This repository provides a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. It includes foundational data structures and an efficient shortest path algorithm, making it an ideal resource for students, developers, and anyone looking to deepen their understanding of data structures in C++. Each code file includes comments for easier comprehension and potential customization.

## Features
1. Binary Tree
* Implementation of a binary tree structure with common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and search.
* Includes additional functionality for managing tree height, balancing, and leaf node identification.
2. Dynamic Queue
* A dynamically allocated queue implementation that supports basic queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.
* Efficiently resizes as needed, making it memory-efficient for varying data loads.
3. Dynamic Stack
* Dynamic stack implementation that adjusts in size as elements are pushed or popped, optimizing memory usage.
* Supports standard stack operations, including push, pop, peek, and checking for an empty stack.
4. Graphs
* Graph representation using adjacency lists or matrices (depending on your preference), enabling an efficient representation of edges and vertices.
* Includes implementations for graph traversal algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
5. Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, designed to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
* Highly optimized to handle various graph sizes and edge weights, and can be adapted for both directed and undirected graphs.
* This project can be a valuable resource for those interested in learning about data structures, preparing for technical interviews, or understanding the underlying mechanics of * * * algorithms in C++.

## Getting Started
* To get started, clone the repository and compile the code using a C++ compiler. Each data structure and algorithm is contained within its own directory, with examples and test cases to * demonstrate usage.
